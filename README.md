# Intro
This repository contains implementation of Unet with Resnet-18 and was deployed on HRF dataset which is the retinasegmentation dataset


HRF dataset can be found here: https://www5.cs.fau.de/research/data/fundus-images/

Just download the python notebook change the root directory for dataloader to wherever you have downloaded data and start training. A simple run on 30 images for training was done with 15 epochs just to test if the code was running fine. You can check the results of this run in the notebook.
